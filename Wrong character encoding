Problem: Characters like æ, ø and å are not encoded correctly in Serverless query - showing as random signs like [%.!]

Solution:

Check collation    
  SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX(DB_NAME(), 'Collation') AS Collation;

Set new collation:
   ALTER DATABASE [SQL-Serverless-Markman-Datahub] COLLATE Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8;
